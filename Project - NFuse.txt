Climate Change Prediction and Mitigation: Climate change is one of the biggest challenges for humanity. Your AI can calculate the impact of emissions on global temperature, analyze the effectiveness of various solutions, predict future scenarios based on different strategies, and propose the most efficient ways to reduce our carbon footprint.
fossil fuels - oil, gas  contribute the largest to climate change 

Fusion power, the process that fuels the sun and stars, is a form of energy generated by fusing two lighter atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus. 
In a fusion process, a significant amount of energy is released, much more than other energy sources such as nuclear fission or fossil fuels. The most frequently used elements in fusion reactions are isotopes of hydrogen - Deuterium and Tritium. When these isotopes fuse, they form helium and a neutron, releasing an enormous amount of energy in the process.

However, reaching the conditions necessary for this reaction to occur is incredibly challenging. The fusion of atomic nuclei requires extraordinarily high temperatures (tens of millions of degrees) and pressure. To achieve these conditions on Earth, scientists use powerful magnetic fields to confine and control the plasma (a state of matter composed of free electrons and atomic nuclei) in a device called a tokamak.

The appeal of fusion power is its potential to offer virtually limitless, clean energy. Unlike fossil fuels, fusion doesn't produce greenhouse gases or air pollutants. And compared to nuclear fission, fusion is much safer as it doesn't create long-lived radioactive waste and carries no risk of a meltdown. 

However, current challenges include the technology's high cost, the difficulty in sustaining the reactions over a prolonged period, and the creation of materials that can withstand the extreme conditions inside the reactor.

While fusion power isn't commercially viable yet, ongoing research and development projects worldwide are making progress. The largest of these is the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project in France, which involves a partnership of 35 countries. ITER is currently building what aims to be the world's largest tokamak, in the hope of proving the feasibility of fusion power on a commercial scale.

Making the nuclei negatively charged -> If the nuclei were negatively charged, they would not be repelled and would not fuse.

look nucleus is made up of neutrons and protons that means electrons also exsists thats why neutrons are there ( electron + protons = neutrons ). so we just have to increase the number of electrons in nucleus so that the nucleus will become ( electrons + neutrons )

Making devices like tokamak or stellarators, but these will be easy and cheap to use and maintain. 

Instead, researchers are exploring various approaches to achieve controlled nuclear fusion, such as magnetic confinement and inertial confinement
